```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timer

## ‚ùå Close

Static helper class for closing forms or the entire application.

### üîπ Close.Form

Closes a specific `Form` instance.

```csharp
using acapi;
using System.Windows.Forms;

public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Close.Form(this); // Closes only this form
    }
}
```

**Parameters:**

* `Form form` ‚Äì The Windows Form you want to close.

---

### üî∏ Close.App

Closes the entire application (forcefully if needed).

```csharp
using acapi;

private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Close.App(); // Closes everything immediately
}
```

**Behavior:**

* Attempts graceful shutdown via `Application.Exit()`.
* Falls back to `Environment.Exit(0)` and `Process.Kill()` to ensure full termination.
* Leaves no residual processes in memory.

---

### üß† Notes

* `Close.Form` is ideal for multi-window apps where only one window needs to close.
* `Close.App` is useful for quick exits, error handling, or "Exit" buttons.

---

## ‚úñÔ∏è Close Process

Tries to find a process by name and asks the user whether to close it:

```csharp
acapi.CloseProcess.AskToClose("notepad"); // tries to find "notepad.exe"
```

```

---

### üîπ Shutdown

```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* Replace `"your_client_id_here"` with your actual Discord App Client ID.

```csharp

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        acapi.DiscordRichPresence.Init("your_client_id_here");
